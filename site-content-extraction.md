**Testimonial 1:**
"Susan is an excellent dentist, I really appreciated that she took the time to listen to my concerns, provide considered and thoughtful advice and talked me through what was happening at each step of the (relatively minor, this visit) procedures she was performing in a very clear (but not at all condescending) manner."
-- Deborah Crittenden, Christchurch

**Testimonial 2:**
"Our 11yo son broke his front tooth again just before we arrived, from an initial break two weeks ago. Elmwood Dental were so friendly and accommodating from my first enquiry with their receptionist Linda, to the dental work from dentist Sherin & her assistant. I was very impressed, happy and satisfied. My son commented how nice they all were."
-- K M, Auckland

**Testimonial 3:**
"My daughter recommended Beata @Elmwood Dental to me. I had become quite apprehensive attempting to find a new dentist after our family dentist had retired. I had put off treatment for quite a long time and was now suffering from toothache. The cost was fair & treatment excellent. I am more than happy to recommend Beata, Roz & Jo @Elmwood."

My enthusiasm lies in providing high-quality dental care with a warm, professional, and honest approach. My focus is always on the patients, and I strongly believe in educating them about the significance of oral health, given its close association with general health. I provide treatment options that are best suited for each individual while respecting financial constraints.

### Testimonial 1
Susan is an excellent dentist, I really appreciated that she took the time to listen to my concerns, provide considered and thoughtful advice and talked me through what was happening at each step of the (relatively minor, this visit) procedures she was performing in a very clear (but not at all condescending) manner. I am generally apprehensive about visiting dentists (like most people, I guess) but will certainly be returning to Elmwood.

Beata is absolutely THE BEST! I cannot recommend enough, her gentle, professional, yet openly honest engaging style. Amazing work. Thank you Beata and the team

Beata is a great professional making nervous patients like myself feel comfortable at her practice.
Beata puts a great effort into her work ensuring great results. She is very conscious about patients not having to go through unnecessary pain or procedures.
The practice is modern and clean and welcoming at the same time with parking on site.
-- **Eva Belley**, Christchurch

### Testimonial 4
I live in Auckland and was in Christchurch last week visiting family. Our 11yo son broke his front tooth again just before we arrived, from an initial break two weeks ago. Elmwood Dental were so friendly and accommodating from my first enquiry with their receptionist Linda, to the dental work from dentist Sherin & her assistant. I was very impressed, happy and satisfied. My son commented how nice they all were. I highly recommend this dental practice and thank the staff once again, for their professionalism and warm welcoming manner.
-- **K M**, Auckland

### Testimonial 5
I have recently changed Dentists and have found Beata to be a great Dentist to look after my teeth. She is both professional and caring, thorough and has a lovely patient / dentist rapport. She seeks further advice to do the best for your situation if this is required. Beata can be trusted to undertake good workmanship for your teeth. I would thoroughly recommend Beata as a wonderful Dentist to look after your oral health.
-- **Vicki Harrington**, Christchurch

### Testimonial 6
She is a ridiculously talented dentist that is not afraid to go the distance. I had so many dentist just shaking their heads, not willing to try and help me. I am a complex case but I just needed a dentist to take the time to listen to me, find a solution with me and take a chance on me. After 20 year of being self conscious and not feeling beautiful, I have a crazy stunning new smile. If you looking for a gentle dentist with exeptional skills...if you want the best of the best, I would recommend Beata. Here is some of my before and after photos
-- **Reinnette Streak**, Christchurch

### Testimonial 7
My daughter recommended Beata @Elmwood Dental to me. I had become quite apprehensive attempting to find a new dentist after our family dentist had retired. I had put off treatment for quite a long time and was now suffering from toothache.
Beata and her lovely team at Elmwood more than matched my daughters description. Exceptionally kind and caring women.
Beata is a genuinely nice person, extremely thorough and professional with her work.
I was given a call after my last treatment to check that my aching tooth had settled down and happy to tell Roz that it had!
Great to find that they care enough to follow up and go the extra mile for their clients.
And I was pleasantly surprised by the price of treatment here as I was expecting to pay more! The cost was fair & treatment excellent.
I am more than happy to recommend Beata, Roz & Jo @Elmwood.
Thank you ladies!
-- **jo butter**, Christchurch

### Testimonial 8
Easily the best dentist I've ever been to by a country mile! The whole staff were super friendly & really helpful, going beyond & above! Beata & Genna were fantastic, highly recommend! They made what's usually a pretty unpleasant experience at the dentist really good... almost enjoyable! If you need some dental work done, don't even bother looking anywhere else, it doesn't get any better than Elmwood Dental. Thank you!
-- **Macaulay Pye**, Christchurch

### Testimonial 9
Probably the best dental experience I've had so far. Beate was lovely, kind and very professional. I loved the clean office and the beautiful views of Norway on the screen during the appointment. I would highly recommend seeing her.

### Section Label: ELMWOOD DENTAL
### Heading: Implant Dentistry

Implant dentistry is an important dental procedure that can help restore the function and appearance of your teeth. Dental implants are artificial tooth roots that are surgically placed into the jawbone, where they fuse with the bone and provide a stable base for replacement teeth.

With implant dentistry, dental implants are placed into the jawbone to provide a stable base for replacement teeth. This procedure can help restore the function and appearance of teeth for a natural-looking smile.

Implant dentistry is an essential procedure for those looking to restore the function and appearance of their teeth. Dental implants serve as artificial tooth roots, providing a stable base for replacement teeth that look and feel natural.

### Section: Implant Dentistry For Optimal Oral Health

### Section: Some Reasons Why You May Need Implant Dentistry

**Missing Teeth:** If you are missing one or more teeth, implant dentistry can provide a permanent, natural-looking solution. Dental implants can be used to replace a single tooth or multiple teeth, and can be customized to match the shape and color of your existing teeth.

**Improving Function:** Implants can help restore normal chewing and speaking function, which can be compromised by missing teeth or other dental issues.

**CTA Buttons:** Call Us Now | Book Online

**Preserving Bone Density:** When a tooth is lost, the bone that supported it can begin to deteriorate over time. Implants can help prevent bone loss by providing a stable base for replacement teeth.

**Improving Confidence:** Dental implants can improve your self-esteem and confidence by restoring a natural-looking smile and improving your overall oral health.

### Related Services Sidebar

**Teeth Whitening:** Teeth whitening lightens the color of your teeth, enhancing your smile. We can offer in office bleaching or home bleaching with individual trays.

**Root Canal Treatment:** Root canal treatment is typically needed when the tooth's innermost layer, containing nerves and blood vessels, becomes inflamed, infected, or damaged.

**Implant:** Dental implants can replace one or more missing teeth. It includes a post/screw which is surgically placed in the jaw first. After a couple of months of healing the implant screw can be assessed for a restorative part with a porcelain crown.

### Section: Ideal Timing For Implant Placement
The best time to consider implant dentistry is typically as soon as possible after a tooth has been lost or extracted. The longer you wait to replace a missing tooth, the more likely it is that the bone will begin to deteriorate, making implant placement more difficult.

## PAGE 8: CONSCIOUS INTRAVENOUS SEDATION
**URL:** https://elmwooddental.co.nz/services/conscious-intravenous-sedation/
**Title:** Conscious Intravenous Sedation - Elmwood Dental
**Last Modified:** March 18, 2025

### Section Label: ELMWOOD DENTAL
### Heading: What is Intravenous conscious sedation?

Kristine has been offering this service for almost 10 years now. It is a great way to ease your dental anxiety.

A medicine Midazolam is used to help you relax and reduce your anxiety about dental treatment. The medication Midazolam is given through a plastic cannula into a vein in your arm.

You may fall asleep during your procedure and you may not remember much. As you relax, your breathing may slow and your blood pressure may reduce a small amount.

We will monitor your breathing, blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen/carbon dioxide levels closely with our patient monitoring machine to ensure you are ok.

We use extra oxygen for you to breathe through the nose.

We also use our normal local anaesthetic into the gums so you feel no pain during your procedure.

### Section: Who is Intravenous sedation ideal for in our practice?
- Patients who suffer from dental anxiety
- Fit and healthy adults or those with mild well controlled medical conditions
- Some children over the age of 12

**CTA Buttons:** Call Us Now | Book Online

### Section: Who is not an ideal candidate for sedation at our practice?
- A history of sleep apnoea or severe snoring
- Someone who is suffering breathing difficulties or symptoms of a cold or flu
- Some medications interact with Midazolam - therefore it is very important to inform your dentists of any medications (including recreational drugs) that you are taking and any allergic reactions you may have
- Alcohol can also interact with Midazolam
- Significant medical conditions eg: liver or kidney disease
- Pregnancy or Breastfeeding
- Hypersensitivity to Benzodiazepine drugs

**CTA Buttons:** Call Us Now | Book Online

### Section: What are the risks?
Midazolam can affect your breathing if you are given too much, that is why we pay close attention to giving you a small amount of the drug for optimal effect.

We also have a reversal drug Flumazenil in the room which we can give you. This is very rarely used. This will reverse the effects of the sedation.

- Drowsiness and confusion are common
- Problems with movement and memory
- Increased risk of falls or injury

### Heading: Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening lightens the color of your teeth, enhancing your smile. It's a popular cosmetic dental procedure. The reasons for teeth whitening may include improving self-confidence, removing stains, preparing for a special occasion or resulting in a more youthful appearance.

**Boosts Confidence & Improves Appearance:**
Whiter teeth can boost confidence and improve appearance, removing stains caused by aging, smoking, and diet. A brighter smile can make you feel more attractive and youthful, with a positive outlook on life.

**Non-Invasive Procedure & Affordable:**
Teeth whitening is a safe and non-invasive way to improve your smile. It can be completed in just one appointment or over a few sessions, and is an affordable cosmetic procedure.

### Section: Signs You Need Teeth Whitening
Here's How Yellow or discolored teeth are signs that you may benefit from teeth whitening. This includes teeth with yellow or brown stains, or teeth that are generally discolored. Additionally, as we age, our teeth naturally become darker and yellowed, and teeth whitening can help restore their brightness, giving a more youthful appearance. Certain lifestyle factors, such as smoking or consuming foods and drinks that stain teeth (like coffee, tea, and red wine), can contribute to tooth discoloration, and teeth whitening can remove these stains and restore the natural whiteness of your teeth. If you have a special occasion coming up, such as a wedding or job interview, teeth whitening may help you look your best.

Root canal treatment is a dental procedure that is necessary when the pulp, which is the innermost layer of a tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels, becomes infected or inflamed. If left untreated, an infected or inflamed pulp can lead to severe pain, swelling, and even tooth loss.

Elmwood Dental prioritizes preserving and restoring damaged or infected teeth through root canal treatment. Experienced dentists ensure comfort and effectiveness with advanced techniques and technologies.

**Deep decay:** If tooth decay is left untreated, it can spread to the pulp of the tooth and cause an infection or inflammation.

**Repeated dental procedures:** If a tooth has had multiple fillings or other dental procedures, it can weaken over time and become more susceptible to infection.

**Cracks or chips in the tooth:** If a tooth has a crack or chip, it can expose the pulp to bacteria and other harmful substances, which can lead to infection.

**Traumatic injury to the tooth:** If a tooth has been injured or knocked out of place, it can damage the pulp and cause an infection.

### Section Label: ELMWOOD DENTAL
### Heading: Dentures

Dentures are dental prosthetics used to replace missing teeth and their surrounding tissues. They are typically made from acrylic or other materials and are designed to look and function like natural teeth. Dentures can be complete, replacing all the teeth in the upper or lower jaw, or partial, replacing only some missing teeth. There are several types of dentures available, and the type of denture used depends on the patient's needs and preferences. Here are some of the different kinds and types of dental dentures

**Complete Dentures:** These are designed to replace all the teeth in a patient's mouth. They are typically used when a patient has lost all their teeth or when any remaining teeth need to be extracted. Complete dentures come in two forms: conventional and immediate dentures.

Conventional dentures are placed in the patient's mouth after the gum tissue has healed from any extractions, which usually takes several weeks. Immediate dentures, on the other hand, are placed immediately after the teeth are removed.

### Section: Partial Dentures & Implant-Supported Dentures
Partial dentures are used when the patient has some natural teeth remaining in their mouth. They are designed to fill in the gaps left by missing teeth and prevent the remaining teeth from shifting. Partial dentures are attached to the remaining teeth using clasps or connectors.

Implant-supported dentures are designed to be anchored in place by dental implants. The implants are surgically placed in the jawbone and act as artificial roots. The denture is then attached to the implants, providing a secure and stable fit.

### Section: Overdentures & Immediate Dentures
Overdentures are similar to implant-supported dentures, but they are attached to natural teeth instead of dental implants. This type of denture can help preserve any remaining natural teeth while also providing support and stability to the denture.

Immediate dentures are placed immediately after the teeth are extracted. These dentures are designed to be temporary and are used while the gum tissue heals. Once the gum tissue has healed, the patient will need to be fitted with a more permanent denture. This can be often achieved with a denture reline.

### Section: Denture Options And Care At Elmwood Dental
If you are in need of dentures, Elmwood Dental is a great option to consider. Elmwood Dental offers a wide range of denture options to meet the unique needs of each patient.

During your initial consultation, the dentist will perform a comprehensive examination of your mouth and will discuss your treatment options with you. Depending on your needs, the dentist may recommend partial dentures if you have some remaining healthy teeth or complete dentures if you have no remaining teeth.

At Elmwood Dental, the dentists work closely with patients to ensure that their dentures fit comfortably and securely, and they provide guidance on proper care and maintenance of dentures to ensure they last as long as possible.

**Title:** Tooth Extraction - Elmwood Dental

**Last Modified:** 2023-10-31

### Section Label: ELMWOOD DENTAL
### Heading: Tooth Extraction

Tooth extraction is a dental procedure that is typically reserved for cases where a tooth is damaged or cannot be saved through other dental treatments. Here are some common reasons why you may need a tooth extraction

**Severe Tooth Decay:** If tooth decay has damaged the tooth beyond repair, extraction may be necessary to prevent further damage or infection.

**Gum Disease:** Advanced gum disease can cause teeth to become loose and eventually fall out. In some cases, extraction may be necessary to remove a damaged or infected tooth.

**Overcrowding:** If your mouth is overcrowded and there isn't enough room for all your teeth, extraction may be necessary to make room for proper alignment.

**Impacted Teeth:** If a tooth is unable to emerge fully from the gum line, it is considered impacted. Impacted teeth can cause pain, swelling, and infection, and may need to be extracted.

### Section: Determining The Right Timing For Tooth Extraction
The best time to have a tooth extraction depends on the reason for the extraction. If a tooth is causing significant pain or discomfort, extraction may be necessary right away to alleviate symptoms and prevent further damage. In other cases, such as overcrowding or impacted teeth, extraction may be recommended as part of a long-term treatment plan.

### Section Label: ELMWOOD DENTAL
### Heading: Wisdom Teeth Removal

Kristine has been removing wisdom teeth for almost 10 years now and really enjoys it. The surgery often involves intravenous conscious sedation to make the experience more comfortable.

There is often little room for wisdom teeth in our mouth as the size of our jaws have evolved over time. This lack of space can cause the wisdom teeth to impact (or get stuck in their eruption) and become inflamed or damage the adjacent teeth.

Sometimes we can get a significant infection around the gum due to plaque and bacteria accumulation around the partially erupted wisdom tooth, if untreated these infections can be dangerous.

Other symptoms of wisdom teeth problems can include ear ache, a bad taste, aching in the jaw, facial swelling, swollen lymph glands, sore throat and difficulty opening the mouth.

Removing wisdom teeth does carry some risks and Kristine will be sure to go through these with you at your consultation appointment. The best age to get your wisdom teeth removed is 18-25 years.

The wisdom teeth are often taken out in two or more pieces after an incision is made into the gum. There will be stitches to help with healing which dissolve on their own in 2-3 weeks.

Recovery time varies depending on the degree of difficulty of the procedure. It is common to have swelling and bruising in the days that follow the procedure. Most patients take a few days off their daily activities to recover and rest.

Elmwood Dental offers Botox (Dysport) treatments as part of their cosmetic dental services. Both Botox and Dysport are neuromodulators that can be used to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around the face, including the mouth and lips.

Botox and Dysport treatments can be important in dentistry for a variety of reasons. One key reason is that they can be used to alleviate certain dental conditions, such as temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), a condition that can cause pain and discomfort in the jaw, face, and neck.

In addition to treating TMJ, Botox or Dysport injections can also be used to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around the mouth and jaw area, leading to an improved cosmetic appearance. This makes them a versatile treatment option for both functional and cosmetic purposes in dentistry.

### Section: Aesthetic Uses Of Botox And Dysport In Dentistry
Botox and Dysport treatments can also be used to address certain aesthetic concerns in dentistry. For example, they can be used to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around the mouth and lips, which can help to create a more youthful, refreshed appearance. This can be particularly beneficial for patients who are seeking a comprehensive approach to oral health and aesthetics.
