    quote: 'Susan is an excellent dentist, I really appreciated that she took the time to listen to my concerns, provide considered and thoughtful advice and talked me through what was happening at each step of the (relatively minor, this visit) procedures she was performing in a very clear (but not at all condescending) manner. I am generally apprehensive about visiting dentists (like most people, I guess) but will certainly be returning to Elmwood.',

    quote: 'I live in Auckland and was in Christchurch last week visiting family. Our 11yo son broke his front tooth again just before we arrived, from an initial break two weeks ago. Elmwood Dental were so friendly and accommodating from my first enquiry with their receptionist Linda, to the dental work from dentist Sherin & her assistant. I was very impressed, happy and satisfied. My son commented how nice they all were. I highly recommend this dental practice and thank the staff once again, for their professionalism and warm welcoming manner.',

    quote: 'She is a ridiculously talented dentist that is not afraid to go the distance. I had so many dentist just shaking their heads, not willing to try and help me. I am a complex case but I just needed a dentist to take the time to listen to me, find a solution with me and take a chance on me. After 20 year of being self conscious and not feeling beautiful, I have a crazy stunning new smile. If you looking for a gentle dentist with exeptional skills...if you want the best of the best, I would recommend Beata. Here is some of my before and after photos',

    quote: 'My daughter recommended Beata @Elmwood Dental to me. I had become quite apprehensive attempting to find a new dentist after our family dentist had retired. I had put off treatment for quite a long time and was now suffering from toothache.\nBeata and her lovely team at Elmwood more than matched my daughters description. Exceptionally kind and caring women.\nBeata is a genuinely nice person, extremely thorough and professional with her work.\nI was given a call after my last treatment to check that my aching tooth had settled down and happy to tell Roz that it had!\nGreat to find that they care enough to follow up and go the extra mile for their clients.\nAnd I was pleasantly surprised by the price of treatment here as I was expecting to pay more! The cost was fair & treatment excellent.\nI am more than happy to recommend Beata, Roz & Jo @Elmwood.\nThank you ladies!',

They made what's usually a pretty unpleasant experience at the dentist really good... almost enjoyable! If you need some dental work done, don't even bother looking anywhere else, it doesn't get any better than Elmwood Dental. Thank you!",
